## Goal

Ability to create custom rules inside yaml configuration with fast execution.

## Variants

1. [Lua](https://github.com/yuin/gopher-lua)
2. [CEL](https://github.com/google/cel-go)
3. [WASM](https://wazero.io/)

### [Why not JavaScript, Lua, or WASM?](https://github.com/google/cel-go?tab=readme-ov-file#why-not-javascript-lua-or-wasm)

JavaScript and Lua are rich languages that require sandboxing to execute
safely. Sandboxing is costly and factors into the "what will I let users
evaluate?" question heavily when the answer is anything more than O(n)
complexity.

CEL evaluates linearly with respect to the size of the expression and the input
being evaluated when macros are disabled. The only functions beyond the
built-ins that may be invoked are provided by the host environment. While
extension functions may be more complex, this is a choice by the application
embedding CEL.

But, why not WASM? WASM is an excellent choice for certain applications and
is far superior to embedded JavaScript and Lua, but it does not have support
for garbage collection and non-primitive object types require semi-expensive
calls across modules. In most cases CEL will be faster and just as portable
for its intended use case, though for node.js and web-based execution CEL
too may offer a WASM evaluator with direct to WASM compilation.

## Concrete use case

User creates `if` rules for certain errors.

```yaml
custom-rules:
  - message: "files inside dir/ can't be modified, only deletion allowed"
    if: "diff.find(`^dir/.*$`).Additions > 0"
  - message: "module `test_utils` can be imported only inside test files"
    if: "diff.contains(`test_utils`, addition)"
```

## How to make useful reporting

{{< alert context="info" >}}
{{< markdownify >}}

##### If without context

```yaml
message: "files inside dir/ can't be modified, only deletion allowed"
if: "diff.find(`^dir/.*$`).Additions > 0"
```

- Easy to write
- **BUT** hard to find invalid commit or file

{{< /markdownify >}}
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert context="info" >}}
{{< markdownify >}}

##### List return

```yaml
message: "files inside dir/ can't be modified, only deletion allowed"
find: "testMap.filter(k, testMap[k].Integer > 100).map(k, testMap[k].StringField)"
```

```yaml
error: files inside dir/ can't be modified, only deletion allowed
invalid objects: [ test-file-go, other-file.go ]
```

- Obvious which objects is invalid
- **BUT** additional `map` step required
- **BUT** it is not unified reporting format

{{< /markdownify >}}
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert context="success" >}}
{{< markdownify >}}

##### Get error contexts from return value type

1. No context (just message) - bool or unknown string return
2. commit - filtered []Commit list return
3. diff file - diff map keys string list or []FileDiff list return
4. diff line (future feature) - like diff file but with `:11,28`

```yaml
message: "files inside dir/ can't be modified, only deletion allowed"
func: "testMap.filter(k, testMap[k].Integer > 100)"
```

- Obvious which objects is invalid
- Unified reporting format

## cel-go problems

It possible to use native types by `ext.NativeTypes(reflect.ValueOf(SomeStruct{}))`
But struct fields in TitleCamelCase.

All macros in lower case, so it is good to have lower case fields names.

Options:

1. Create patch to cel-go with customizable field reflection
2. Copy and edit `ext.NativeTypes`
3. Use protobuf generated structure
4. Use type provider wrapper to rename field names

{{< alert context="success" >}}
{{< markdownify >}}

A lot of experiments with CEL were made.

Custom TypeProvider.FindStructFieldType is the best solution. It is simple and allows to use just Go structs and any
case for field names (camel, snake and kebab)

Custom values can be retrieved like this.

```go
&types.FieldType{
Type: types.StringType,
IsSet: func (target any) bool {
return true
},
GetFrom: func (target any) (any, error) {
return target.(SomeStruct).Map[fieldName], nil
},
}
```
