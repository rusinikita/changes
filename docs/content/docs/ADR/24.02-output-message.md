### Log level vs all errors

Danger has ability to post different types of messages:
error, warning, and message.

`changes check` hasn't, because check command main goal - finding mistakes.
Other instruments or commands solve other cases.

### Group by error vs group by object

Group by commit and file used
because user wants to fix all issues in file or message at one time.

### `:1:1` at the path end

Tools can recognize path output and replace it with link to open.
