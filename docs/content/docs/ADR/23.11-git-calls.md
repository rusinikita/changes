## What

Program must get data from git repository:

- Files diff
- Commit names and authors

## How

{{< alert context="info" >}}
{{< markdownify >}}

### git cli calls

This method is used by [reviewdog](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog)

Pros:

- Simple execution

Cons:

- Require result parsing
- App depends on git cli

{{< /markdownify >}}
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert context="success" >}}
{{< markdownify >}}

### go-git library

This method known to me. I used it in [devex](https://github.com/rusinikita/devex)

Pros:

- Compile safety
- No dependency on external apps
- Allows parallel data fetching (speed)

Cons:

- Binary size
- Rare dependency

## Package design

```go
type Git interface {
    // Branches returns PR source and target branch
    Branches() (source, target string)
    // Commits returns PR commits
    Commits() []Commit
    // Changes returns PR repository files diff
    Changes() []FileChange
}
```

Few methods to create it:

- `InitPR` creates diff between current and target branch (like PR diff)
- `InitLast` creates diff for last N current branch commits

{{< alert context="info" >}}
{{< markdownify >}}

Why publicity and full abstraction from go-git:

1. Current benefit for this project. Package can be used now for checks automation via go scripts.
2. Current benefit for my work projects. Package can be used outside this project as library.
3. Full DI control in other packages tests.
