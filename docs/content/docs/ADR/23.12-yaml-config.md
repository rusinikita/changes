## Motivation

Simple json/yaml/toml configuration - key feature. That is more effective than the [Danger](https://danger.systems/js/).

[See project goal here]({{<ref "docs/adr/23.10-init.md#project-goal">}})

## Checkers

1. PR changes max lines
2. Commit changes max lines
3. Commit format: max length and title regex
4. Footer regex or footer words
5. Conventional commits (check + changelog)
6. Emoji ban, symbol set whitelist
7. Rebase forcing

```yaml
commits:
  #    max: 10
  pr-limit: 10 # max commits per PR
  subject: # default - conventional commit
    format: "(task) (context)?: (type) (title)"
    types: [ feat, fix, chore, docs ]
    limits:
      title: 50
      context: 5
    unique: [title] # commits should not repeat this

  body:
    width-limit: 80

  task-regex: ^abc-123

  banned-words:
    - emoji
    - fixed -> fix
      
  author:
    regex: (.+)@company.com

diff:
  total-max: 2000
  per-file-max:
    additions: 300
    deletions: 1000
    all: 1000
  must-change: [ "changelog.md" ]
  protected-files:
    paths: [ ".golangci-lint", "git-checks.go" ]
    allowed-authors: [ "bibaboba@gmail.com" ]
```

## Footers and task validation

Type of footers
- key value `ref: #123`
- value `#123`

```yaml
footer:
  - key: task # task: #123
    format: task
    required: true
  - format: task # #123
    required: true
  - key: breaking_change # breaking_change: $break_description
  - key: see-also # "see also: $task"
    format: task
  - key: something-custom # something-custom: 123-blabla
    format: custom-custom # must be declared value
  - key: context
    format: context
```

## Values validation

```yaml
values:
  type:
    - allowed: [ feat, fix, chore, docs ]
  title:
    - limit: 50
  body:
    - limit: 500
      width-limit: 80
  context:
    - limit: 5 # optional
    - allowed: [ docs, some, other ] # optional
  task:
    - regex: ^abc-123
  custom-custom:
    - regex: ^abc-123
      allowed: [ feat, fix, chore, docs ]
      limit: 50
```

Pros of values separation:
- Can be used across all message text (subject, body, footers)
- Same structure
- Single place
- Simpler API for Lua in future because of single map of standard and custom values.

## Testing

Ability to easily test your config is important.

I like Danger, but its local testing with `danger pr` is not comfortable.

### Last commits testing

`changes/git` package already can give last 10 commits data.
We can use that to run checks upon last N commits.

### Samples testing

Configuration can contain sample commits data and simplified expected output.

```yaml
# draft
config-tests:
  commits:
    - message: "test title"
      alias: "first"
      author: "rusinikit@gmail.com"
  expects:
    - checker: "title"
      commits: [ "first" ]
```

Good commits can be used as examples in CLI output for PR message.

#### Problems with diff

Files diff checks is important too. But it's complicated. Feature request required.

## Changelog generation

```yaml
changelog:
  group-by: [context, type] # commit titles will be grouped
  # (version) and (title) will be replaced with params
  title-format: "**(version)**: (title)" # default - **(version)**
  version-tag-format: # how to create new tag
    starts-with: "v"
    type: number # semver, number, commit hash
  commit-message-format: "docs(log): (version)" # how to create new commit
```

### Diff regeneration

Program needs to find a previous version changelog title to replace lines on top of that.
It will look for exact previous version tag symbols appeared in markdown header.

```markdown
## test1.2.3: Some title that will be replaced

Some text that will be replaced.

## v1.2.3: Header that we are looking for

Text that will not be replaced.
```
