## Tools and setup

I very well known with Hugo and Geekdocs. But I found new beautiful doc theme - [lotus](https://lotusdocs.dev/docs/overview/).

I decided to place documentation files inside repository docs folder because:
- It's easier to automate
  - Single change log generation
  - DoD PR checks
- Projects is not a library. First priority - binary distribution. So .md files inside package is not large problem.

ADR naming:  yy-mm-name.md - it's ok if few files inside month unordered. Lotus can order pages by weight, but it's nice to have timeline of titles.

I have idea to make doc pages for Go code, but it's useless now. I'll do it later.

## CI draft

- Generate by hand (junk files) OR by CI (pages branch)? => default CI
- PR doc page preview generation? => maybe, later
- GH Pages or other => GH Pages, nikitarusin.com later
- go modules or theme files or git module => go module (simpler, no junk files)

## Main page

Thesises:
- Goal
- Status: In progress
