{{< alert context="info" >}}
{{< markdownify >}}

Based on [init draft]({{<ref "docs/adr/23.10-init.md#interfaces">}})

{{</ markdownify >}}
{{</ alert >}}

## Goal

Tool intended to be used for complex checking like:

- Feature commit must contain new ADR file
- PR must contain changelog file change
- Only 'docs' commits can contain doc folder changes
- Only 'bump' commits can change package.json
- Only Nikita can edit CI files

## Commit message format is base

Commit type and other information is useful for checkers.
Because of that, commit messages should be parsed first.

```mermaid
flowchart
   parsing[Parse messages]
   context[Create check context]
   execute[Execute checkers]

   parsing -->|type,title,task,footers| context
   context -->|diff cache, commits, settings| execute

   raw[Raw commit]
   commit[Enriched commit]

   raw -->|extract values| commit
```

## Checker context values

There is no profit from overcomplicated solution such as handlers + context.

Solution - set of functions:

- Values validation settings parsing
- Text checking
- Subject parsing
- Footers parsing
- Body checking
- Commits list checking
- Diff checking

## Reporting

We need ability to provide additional error context and group output by this context.

```markdown
8213ff: some commit subject

- incorrect formatting
  8213ff: some other commit subject
- wrong task format
```

{{< alert context="info" >}}
Errors itself can't answer "why there is no error".
{{< /alert >}}

I experimented with different types of logging + error interfaces.
And decided to keep things simple.

There will be errors package:

- Multiple errors collection
- Path adding and grouping

These two features allows to do any kind context error handling and reporting.

Additional logging:

- Main execution stages and steps
- Important variables

## Development plan

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'theme': 'dark' } }%%

   Values
           : Values config
   Commit
           : Subject config
            : Subject validation
    Reporting
            : stdout
            : markdown
```

```mermaid
